#+STARTUP: content

* 1. Introduction

This is an pytorch implementation of [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275][multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm]].

The experimental environment is a modified version of Waterworld based on [[https://github.com/sisl/MADRL][MADRL]]. 

* 2. Environment

The main features (different from MADRL) of the modified Waterworld environment are:

- evaders and poisons now bounce at the wall obeying physical rules
- sizes of the evaders, pursuers and poisons are now the same

* 3. Dependency

- [[https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch][pytorch]]
- [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom][visdom]]
- =python==3.6.1= (recommend using the anaconda/miniconda)
- if you need to render the environments, =opencv= is required

* 4. Install

- Install [[https://github.com/sisl/MADRL][MADRL]].
- Replace the `madrl_environments/pursuit' directory with the one in this repo.
- `python main.py' 

if scene rendering is enabled, recommend to install `opencv' through [[https://github.com/conda-forge/opencv-feedstock][conda-forge]].

* 5. Results
